### Tips to Make Your Unit Tests Great
Unit tests form the critical base of our testing pyramid. Creating a great foundation requires writing a lot of great unit tests! Here are some helpful tips to get you going:

**Keep tests simple and focused:** Each unit test should focus on testing a single, well-defined aspect of the code such as a single code path through a function or method. A complex test that tries to cover multiple scenarios at once should be split into smaller tests. Simplicity makes it easier to understand and maintain the tests.

**Use descriptive names:** This makes it much easier to maintain the test going forward. Inevitably requirements will change and someone will need to update the tests. A great name will provide the needed information about the purpose of the test without having to read the code.

**Use mocking and stubs:** This technique allows you to isolate the unit under test from its dependencies, like databases or services. Then you can focus on the particular unitâ€™s behavior without relying on internal systems.

**Cover Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:** Ensure that your unit tests cover edge cases and boundary conditions. This refers to scenarios that are at the extreme ends of the expected behavior. For example, if a function has an integer parameter, test it with both the minimum and maximum valid values as well as with invalid values.

**Test happy paths and error cases:** Build positive test cases for successful code paths and negative cases to handle unexpected or erroneous inputs. This helps ensure that your code behaves robustly and handles errors gracefully.

**Keep security in mind:** Consider common attack vectors like SQL and Command Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and deserialization. Getting unit tests around these adds fantastic quality assurance value to your testing process.

### Tips to Make Your Unit Tests Great
Unit tests form the critical base of our testing pyramid. Creating a great foundation requires writing a lot of great unit tests! Here are some helpful tips to get you going:

**Keep tests simple and focused:** Each unit test should focus on testing a single, well-defined aspect of the code such as a single code path through a function or method. A complex test that tries to cover multiple scenarios at once should be split into smaller tests. Simplicity makes it easier to understand and maintain the tests.

**Use descriptive names:** This makes it much easier to maintain the test going forward. Inevitably requirements will change and someone will need to update the tests. A great name will provide the needed information about the purpose of the test without having to read the code.

**Use mocking and stubs:** This technique allows you to isolate the unit under test from its dependencies, like databases or services. Then you can focus on the particular unitâ€™s behavior without relying on internal systems.

**Cover Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions:** Ensure that your unit tests cover edge cases and boundary conditions. This refers to scenarios that are at the extreme ends of the expected behavior. For example, if a function has an integer parameter, test it with both the minimum and maximum valid values as well as with invalid values.

**Test happy paths and error cases:** Build positive test cases for successful code paths and negative cases to handle unexpected or erroneous inputs. This helps ensure that your code behaves robustly and handles errors gracefully.

**Keep security in mind:** Consider common attack vectors like SQL and Command Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and deserialization. Getting unit tests around these adds fantastic quality assurance value to your testing process.

#### Python Example

Here is a simple example of using unit tests in Python using the built-in unittest framework. We will revisit the calculator concept from chapter two, in this case focusing on the division function since that is a great example of where things can go wrong. Here is the method under test:

#### math_functions.py

```
def divide_numbers(a, b):
    """Divides inputs as integers"""
    if b == 0:
        raise ValueError("Division by zero is not allowed")
    return a / b
```

Now let's implement some unit tests.
1. Add a positive test case for the "happy path" that we expect to not throw an error.
2. Add a negative test case for the expected error with divide by zero.

#### test_math_functions.py

```
import unittest
from math_functions import divide_numbers

class TestMathFunctions(unittest.TestCase):

    def test_divide_numbers_normal:
        """Test normal integer division"""
        # Simple division
        result = divide_numbers(6, 2)
        self.assertEqual(result, 3)

        # Divide positive by negative
        result = divide_numbers(4, -2)
        self.assertEqual(result, -2)

    def test_divide_by_zero:
        """Check that division by zero raises a ValueError"""
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError):
            divide_numbers(5, 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

This just scratches the surface of possible tests. Here's some more ideas:
- The divide_numbers method does not enforce typing of the input variables. Test for None input and different input types such as a str or list.
- Test case for if decimals are passed in.
- Test case for if the result of division would be fractional.

### Our New Frenemy: DevOps

**DevOps** is the new department on the block that represents the intersection of _software development_ and _IT operations_. Most of the developers at our company find them annoying, but a great DevOps team can really benefit an organizationâ€™s code quality.
- DevOps practices emphasize automation, continuous integration, and continuous delivery (CI/CD), allowing organizations to release software updates and features more frequently. This faster release cycle enables _quicker responses_ to market demands and competitive pressures.
- Automation of testing, deployment, and infrastructure provisioning _reduces the chances of human errors_. Continuous testing ensures that issues are caught early in the development process, resulting in higher software quality.
- DevOps practices encourage the use of automated deployment pipelines and infrastructure as code. This leads to _consistent and repeatable processes_, reducing the likelihood of deployment failures and minimizing downtime.
- Automated infrastructure provisioning allows organizations to _scale resources_ up or down based on demand. This elasticity improves application performance and user experience during peak usage periods.
- Continuous monitoring and automated alerting enable teams to identify and address issues quickly. This _reduces_ the **mean time to resolution (MTTR)** and _improves system reliability_.
- Automation and efficient resource management lead to reduced manual intervention, shorter development cycles, and optimized infrastructure usage. This can result in _lower operational costs_ over time.
- DevOps encourages a _culture of experimentation and innovation_. Automated deployment pipelines make it easier to test new ideas and features, allowing teams to iterate and learn rapidly.
- DevOps includes _security_ as a crucial aspect of the software development process. Security practices are integrated from the beginning, _reducing the risk_ of vulnerabilities and ensuring compliance.
- The combination of rapid releases, high-quality software, and responsiveness to customer feedback enhances _customer satisfaction and loyalty_.

Those all sound like rad benefits! Some processes DevOps can really help to automate to improve code quality are **code reviews, static code and software composition analysis (SCA)**.

**Code reviews**, also known as **peer reviews** or **pull request (PR)** reviews, are a fundamental practice in software development where developers examine and evaluate each other's code changes before they are merged into the main codebase.

Code reviews help ensure that code adheres to _best practices_ and is _well-structured_. Reviewers can catch and address bugs or issues before they become more challenging and expensive to _fix defects_ later on.

Code reviews provide an opportunity for team members to _share insights_, expertise, and knowledge about the codebase. Junior developers can learn from more experienced team members through code reviews, _improving_ their skills and _understanding_. Feedback received in code reviews encourages developers to improve their coding practices over time.

### Decoding the Alphabet Soup: SCA, SAST, DAST

**Static Code Analysis (SCA)** and **Static Analysis Software Testing (SAST)** involve analyzing the source code without actually executing it. The analysis checks for coding violations, potential bugs, and adherence to coding standards. Here's how it helps improve code:
- SCA tools _identify_ common programming _errors_ like null pointer dereferences, buffer overflows, and logical inconsistencies. Finding these issues early helps prevent bugs and crashes in the production environment.
- SCA tools _enforce_ coding _standards_, ensuring that code is consistent and follows best practices. This improves _readability_ and _maintainability_.
- SCA tools can _identify_ code patterns that are commonly associated with _security vulnerabilities_, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.
- SCA tools can point out areas of code that are overly complex, making it easier to identify places where refactoring can _simplify the logic_.
- Static analysis _identifies issues_ during the development phase, allowing developers to address problems before they propagate throughout the codebase.

A similar concept is **software composition analysis**. This focuses on identifying and managing **third-party components** and **libraries** (open-source or proprietary) used within a software project. This is crucial because relying on vulnerable or outdated components can introduce **security risks**. Here's how SCA helps improve code:
- SCA tools identify known vulnerabilities in the third-party components used in the codebase. This helps _prevent security breaches_ caused by using outdated or insecure libraries.
- SCA tools help identify whether the components used adhere to the project's licensing requirements. This _avoids legal issues_ related to open-source licenses.
- By identifying risky components early, SCA tools allow developers to _make informed decisions_ about whether to use, update, or replace certain components.
- SCA tools provide information about the latest versions of components, ensuring that the project uses the most current and _secure versions_.

**Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)** is a security testing methodology used in the field of application security to _identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses_ in web applications and **application programming interfaces (APIs)**. DAST is primarily concerned with assessing an application from the outside, simulating how an attacker might interact with it. DAST doesn't require access to the application's source code and doesn't have detailed knowledge of the application's internal structure and is therefore classified as a black-box test. This is the process flow of DAST:
- DAST tools automatically **scan** a running application by sending various HTTP requests to its endpoints, just like a real user or attacker would. These requests can include common attack vectors like SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and more.
- The tool **analyzes** the responses received from the application to detect any signs of vulnerabilities or security weaknesses. This analysis typically involves checking for known security vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other issues.
- DAST tools generate detailed **reports** that highlight the identified vulnerabilities, their severity, and often include recommendations for remediation. These reports help developers and security professionals understand the potential risks and take appropriate actions to mitigate them.

What advantages does DAST provide for security testing?
- DAST is _non-intrusive_ because it doesn't require access to the application's source code or deep knowledge of its internal workings. It interacts with the application over the network, making it suitable for testing third-party applications and services.
- DAST tools _simulate real-world attacks and interactions_, making it possible to discover vulnerabilities that might be missed by static analysis tools or manual code reviews.
- DAST can be _automated and scaled_. This allows it to be used to scan large and complex applications, making it efficient for identifying vulnerabilities across a wide range of web assets.

While DAST is a valuable tool for identifying vulnerabilities in web applications, it has some limitations. It may produce false positives or miss certain vulnerabilities, especially those that require specific user actions to trigger. Therefore, it is often recommended to complement DAST with other security testing methods like Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and manual penetration testing to ensure comprehensive coverage of an application's security posture.

These are all measures a great DevOps team can help your development organization with. These practices help mature your software development practice and lead to software that is of high quality, secure, and reliable.

## Chapter 1: Why Testing Matters <a id="ch01-why-testing-matters"></a>

### Software is Changing the World

Computer software is a continuing revolution transforming every industry. This runs the spectrum from the apps on wearable devices and smartphones to systems powering major industries. The processes we use to create, test, and deliver software need to evolve to stay competitive.

A simple change to a line of code can have massive implications, good or ill. A cliche well known by Spider-Man fans is “With great power comes great responsibility.” Software quality and security become increasingly important as software eats our world.

This book aims to cut through the buzzwords and present you with the techniques your team needs to rise to this challenge as a software developer, quality assurance expert, or manager.

### Buggy Software Leads Companies to Financial Ruin

One of my previous employers was a manufacturing company in Wisconsin. Our development team built applications to support our transportation and distribution division.

The team’s development processes were archaic: only manual testing was conducted and there were no procedures for code reviews, automated testing, or static code analysis. Of course the team released low-quality software.

When the company faced poor financial performance they could no longer afford to make payroll. Where did they have to make cuts? The development department: all the junior staff were cut from our team. Embrace the challenge of continuous improvement to keep your staff productive and well-paid!

### Why Testing Matters

Many software teams struggle against the crushing pressure of software defects coming in day after day. The tedium of triaging and debugging incoming issues drains developer productivity. Instead of coding new features or building skills, the developers need to read through client reports, gather information from the support team, and wade through the mud of legacy code.

Fighting fires this way burns out developers and management. Customers become distressed that they have purchased low-quality software and take it out on management and the support staff. This causes irreparable dissatisfaction across the organization.

Releasing defective software for the sake of meeting deadlines creates technical debt. Debt is certainly a useful tool that everyone ought to leverage, and often a proof of concept or minimum viable product is what is needed to move forward on a project.

Yet when defective software is released consistently this debt snowballs into a crushing burden. You can prevent this by shifting left to get ahead of such issues. This book will describe the key techniques software teams can use to accomplish this, including test and behavior driven development, automated testing, and software composition analysis.

Software testing is often thought of as a **quality assurance (QA)** role. Unfortunately QA is often treated as a lesser role than software development both in terms of status and pay. Do not make this mistake! Having great testing and QA gives your organization confidence that both regulatory and customer requirements are being met. Automating your QA and testing process presents an intriguing challenge to unleash your staff's creativity.

### Embrace Automation

Meet Lee, our former Software QA Lead who bears a striking resemblance to Homer Simpson. Lee had a unique charm that brightened our tech office. He was known for talking to himself loudly, engaging in spirited debates with his inner monologue.

But what truly made Lee stand out was his mechanical keyboard. Its thunderous keystrokes filled the office, turning software testing into a rhythmic symphony. Each keypress was a beat in Lee's quest for perfection.

Lee's intensity shone brightest during the intense workweeks before software releases. He led the QA team with infectious passion, turning stress into an exhilarating adventure. His humor and camaraderie made the impossible feel achievable.

Lee's quirks and dedication became a cherished part of our office culture. He showed us that professionalism and fun could coexist, even as he bashed away on his keyboard and carried on animated conversations with himself. Lee is an unforgettable character who added color and inspiration to our software team.

The problem our team faced was that Lee and the Bangalore test team had to consistently work long hours every other Wednesday and Thursday night to get our releases out on time. Much of the tedious work in QA can be automated by building software scripts. Scripting languages are code used to manipulate, customize and automate the facilities of an existing system

Implementing test automation reduced the workload that our testing team needed to do. The dark side of automation is that the organizations will hire fewer testers, so there is less job opportunity at the low-end of the software QA testing field. The benefit to the business is lower costs. The benefit to the QA testers is they work fewer hours, are less stressed and less likely to burn out.
